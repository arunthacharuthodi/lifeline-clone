<p><strong>Full mouth scale and clean at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>It is important to visit your local dentist at least once in 6 months. Even when you brush twice a day, there are certain places in your mouth that a traditional brush cannot reach leading to plaque collection in that area.</p>
<p>If you don’t visit your dentist regularly, you might end up with numerous of dental problems such as tartar build-up from the plaque or more serious problems such as gingivitis, periodontal disease or bleeding painful gums etc. We at Lifeline Wisdom Dental give a full package of scaling and cleaning to our patients which ensure that your mouth and teeth are regularly cleaned and any possible problems can be identified early on.</p>
<p><strong>How to identify Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>If your gums start hurting or become inflamed or even worse start bleeding when you brush, then this is a sign of periodontal disease and you should get it checked immediately. This can be a sign of something worse to come if not caught and treated early. Other symptoms include bad breath, receding gums or tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How to treat Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>The best cure for gingivitis or periodontal disease is to get regular cleaning and scaling from your dentist. A deep cleaning on a regular basis can save you from a lot of problems in the future and help you maintain your beautiful and healthy smile. It can also save your from costly treatments in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Scale and Clean appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the clean, you will feel vibrations on your teeth which may cause a sensitive sensation for some people but are not painful.</li>
<li>Once you are done, you can go back home and resume normal activities. This procedure does not require any downtime.</li>
<li>It is important to visit your dentist or dental hygienist once or twice a year to get a scale and clean to avoid tooth decay and serious gum diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for proper brushing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you brush your teeth slowly and in gentle circular motions.</li>
<li>Make sure you keep brushing your teeth for 2 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Replace your brush every 3 months.</li>
<li>Do not forget to clean your tongue gently with your brush.</li>

<p>Do you feel like your teeth are damaged? Do you feel sensitivity when you consume hot and cold foods and drinks? Book your appointment today at Lifeline Wisdom Dental to know the available treatments and fillings to solve these problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different kinds of fillings available</li>
<li>Mostly done in one appointment</li>
<li>Get rid of sensitivity and pain</li>
<li>Repair your damaged teeth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dental fillings at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>In order to treat a cavity, your dentist needs to remove the decayed part of your tooth and replace it with an artificial filling. Fillings can also be used to treat cracked or broken teeth. There are several materials used for dental fillings:</p>
<p><strong>How to identify if you are in need of a dental filling?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to hot and cold</li>
<li>Toothache or pain</li>
<li>Bleeding while flossing or brushing</li>
<li>Tooth that feels rough to the touch</li>
<li>Broken tooth due to accident or contact sports</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all cavities are painful and you may not be able to tell for a long time that you are in need of a filling. This is why it is important that you visit your dentist on a regular basis or every 6 months for scaling and cleaning your tooth so such problems can be identified.</p>
<p><strong>Different kinds of fillings available at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<p>Composite fillings:</p>
<p>Composite fillings are tooth-colored fillings and they are made from resin. They are a good option for small to mid-sized fillings and are great for people who prefer a matching filling on their tooth.</p>
<p>Glass Ionomer fillings:</p>
<p>Glass Ionomer fillings form a chemical bond with the tooth and are also tooth colored. They are not as strong as composite fillings but a good option to fill in the corners of the teeth. They also prevent further tooth decay by releasing fluoride. These also require less time because they are done fairly quickly. These types of fillings are also used on baby teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lays and On lays:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lays and On lays are high-strength fillings and they are used for molars and pre-molars. These can also be used to fill a tooth that is too damaged to support a basic filling. They are mostly used for restorative work to the teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your filling appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book your appointment with our highly qualified dentist and come in relaxed. Getting a filling is a relatively painless procedure and it does not take very long. The filling is prepared, attached to your tooth and polished and you are done.</li>
<li>In lays and on lays require more than one visit but the other fillings are completed in one sitting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your fillings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid eating hard or sticky foods.</li>
<li>Avoid very hot or cold drinks and food.</li>
<li>Bite and chew carefully.</li>
<li>Avoid chewing in the area for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Be careful not to bite your lips and tongue if numb.</li>
<li>Report to your dentist if the filling comes out or the area starts bleeding.</li>
</ul>

<li>If your tooth gets knocked out by dental injury or accident, don’t panic. Clean and save the knocked out tooth by putting it in milk. Be careful not to touch the tooth by the root end and to only handle it by the crown end so the roots do not get damaged. Once you have saved the tooth, call our practice immediately and we will book you in on the nearest available appointment.</li>
<li>If you have any post-surgery complications from an extraction or root canal such as infection which can be identified by pain and swelling around the affected area or you may experience a fever, call our clinic immediately and you will be booked in as soon as possible.</li>

<p>Fissure sealants are made of a plastic or resin material and are painted over the grooves of teeth to stop food and debris from getting stuck in your teeth. The stop your teeth from collecting bacteria and decaying. Visit Lifeline Wisdom Dental to find out more!</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection from decay</li>
<li>Quick and easy to apply</li>
<li>Long lasting</li>
<li>Cost effective</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When are fissure sealants needed?</strong></p>
<p>There are many small depressions called ‘pits’ or grooves called ‘fissures’ in our teeth. Mostly present in molars and pre-molars but can also be present in the front teeth. Seeing as how these pits and fissures can collect bacteria, food and debris over time, they make it easier for plaque to form and cause decay.</p>
<p>Fissure sealants are a type of plastic or resin filling that are used to cover these grooves or fissures so you or your kids do not have to face bigger dental problems in the future.</p>
<p>Fissure sealants also make it easy to brush and clean your teeth. It is advised that you should get fissure sealants for kids as soon as their teeth erupt- at the age of 6-7 years old which is when they are most effective as well.</p>
<p><strong>How long do fissure sealants last?</strong></p>
<p>Fissure sealants generally last anywhere from five to ten years and are a relatively cost effect alternative and protect you from future complications.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Fissure Sealant appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a quick and easy procedure and also a painless one. It usually just takes one appointment.</li>
<li>Your dentist will clean and prepare your tooth first. This is to ensure that all debris is removed before application.</li>
<li>Then the dentist makes sure that the surface is completely dry before applying the sealant.</li>
<li>Once applied a curing light will be used on the tooth to harden the filling.</li>
<li>Once the sealant is in place and hardened, your dentist will ask you to check if it is comfortable and does not interfere with your bite. If everything is perfect, you will go home and there is no downtime required for this procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips to care for fissure sealants:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even with sealant on your teeth, make sure to brush all the surfaces of your teeth well.</li>
<li>Use a soft toothbrush for your teeth.</li>
<li>Remember that even though your teeth are sealed, you can still get a gum infection from tartar build up near your gums.</li>
<li>Make sure to brush the sides and tops of your teeth.</li>

<p>Make over your smile today by getting dental veneers. Call Lifeline Wisdom Dental today for a complete smile makeover!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get back your smile</li>
<li>Restore your confidence</li>
<li>Long lasting results</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are Veneers?</strong></p>
<p>A veneer is a thin covering that is applied over your original teeth giving them a much whiter look and the appearance of a more regular and symmetrical smile. This particular treatment may be required if your teeth are chipped, stained and discoloured or there are gaps between your teeth. As these are much thinner and less preparation of the original tooth is required in comparison to a crown, these can be a more affordable and practical option for those who have less damage to their teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Veneers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Porcelain Veneers: These types of veneers resemble the natural look of your teeth and resist staining. These are custom made in the lab and fitted according to your specifications. However, they have to be replaced if they get chipped or break.</li>
<li>Composite Veneers: These are a less costly alternative than porcelain veneers and are made out of a composite resin and are bonded directly to your teeth. They also have a shorter application process as compared to porcelain veneers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who can get Dental Veneers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your teeth are in relatively good health but are misshapen, discoloured or chipped,</li>
<li>If you have good gum health and are able to sustain good oral health,</li>
<li>If your tooth enamel is not damaged and is in good condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you are the perfect candidate for dental veneers.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Veneers appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your dentist will thoroughly clean your teeth and some of your tooth enamel will be taken and sent to the lab.</li>
<li>Then your dentist will prepare a mould of your teeth and that will also be sent to the lab and you will be fitted with temporary veneers till your next appointment.</li>
<li>At your next appointment, your dentist will bond the prepared veneers to your teeth with resin cement.</li>
<li>Another follow up appointment may be required for contouring the veneers and to check your overall gum health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for taking care of your Veneers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth such as coffee, tea or wine.</li>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth regularly just as you would your natural teeth.</li>
<li>Avoid eating very hard foods to avoid breakage or chipping of the veneers.</li>
</ul>

<p>A root canal helps to keep your tooth pain-free and infection free. Book your appointment today at Lifeline Wisdom Dental.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alleviation of pain and distress</li>
<li>Maintain your tooth health</li>
<li>Prevent spread of infection</li>
<li>Cost effective treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do you need a root canal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent pain and sensitivity to hot and cold food and drinks</li>
<li>Tooth discoloration or swollen gums</li>
<li>Pain while eating or touching the tooth</li>
<li>Cracked or chipped tooth can also lead to infection</li>
<li>A loose tooth that is weak or about to break</li>
<li>A tooth that is injured by trauma or accident</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is important to get them treated right away. Consult our team of highly skilled dentists today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your root canal appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive to our clinic for your appointment, you will be escorted to the treatment room.</li>
<li>A local anesthesia will be injected to your treatment area. You will be awake during your procedure but you will not feel any pain.</li>
<li>When your tooth is numb, the infected pulp will be removed from the inside of your tooth.</li>
<li>Then your dentist will cover the area with antibiotics and seal it.</li>
<li>Your tooth will then be filled with a temporary filling which protect your teeth canals from getting infected in the future.</li>
<li>The root canal treatment is usually completed in 2-3 sittings depending on the damage to the tooth.</li>
<li>Lastly, when the treatment is completed, the tooth is covered with a permanent crown.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is better to get a root canal for a damaged tooth than to get it extracted. This way you do not lose your natural bite and it can also help with maintaining the appearance of your teeth. Root canals are also less expensive than implants or extractions.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for care after your tooth after root canal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not bite down or chew your food on the side of the treated tooth at least for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Avoid hard or sticky foods.</li>
<li>Avoid eating or drinking hot and cold foods until the anesthesia wears off.</li>
<li>If you experience pain or bleeding that lasts after 24 hours, contact your dentist.</li>
<li>Remember that your restored tooth also needs brushing and flossing like a normal tooth requires.</li>

<p><strong>What are dental crowns?</strong></p>
<p>Dental crowns are artificial tooth coloured caps that are placed on top of your natural damaged tooth to improve their appearance. Crowns are also used to fill large fillings or to provide a protective cover after root canal. Porcelain or ceramic crowns can be matched to your teeth and while metal crowns are more effective, they are usually recommended for the back of the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What are dental bridges?</strong></p>
<p>A dental bridge is designed to permanently replace any gap that has been left by any missing teeth with new false ones. This procedure will be suitable for you if the teeth that are surrounding the gap are healthy and strong. Having a gap in your mouth from a missing tooth can cause issues not only to your self-esteem and confidence but can also create potential long term effects to your gums and surrounding teeth over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who can get dental bridges or crowns?</strong></p>
<p>If you have gaps in your teeth, leaving them untreated can cause the surrounding teeth to shift and change their place. That gap is filled by the replacement fake tooth so it can blend with your natural teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Different types of dental bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most commonly used type of dental bridge used. This type of bridge is attached to the surrounding teeth with a fake tooth in between. A traditional bridge is anchored by your own teeth while the fake tooth “bridges” the gap. This may require some adjustments to you’re the adjoining teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cantilever bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>These type of bridges are commonly used towards the front of the mouth and only use a single tooth as an anchor. They can put too much pressure, however, on one tooth and are only advised in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary land bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>For these types of bridges, a metal framework is used as an anchor. This metal frame is bonded to the back of the surrounding teeth and does not require any adjustments to the surrounding teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental bridge or crown appointment at Lifeline Dental Wisdom?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of the procedure the dentist will need to trim and prepare the surrounding teeth in preparation to attach the new bridge.</li>
<li>A mould will be taken and once ready, will be cemented and fixed giving you a completely fresh new smile.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your dental crown and bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth twice daily to maintain your oral health.</li>
<li>Use an interdental brush to clean under the bridge once a day.</li>
<li>Routine 6 monthly check up with the dentist.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Teeth tend to get stained over time as a result of smoking or drinking wine, tea and coffee. Sometimes teeth can also get discolored due to injury or trauma to the tooth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who can get teeth whitening needed?</strong></p>
<p>Bleaching works on natural teeth. Before opting for any teeth whitening treatment, we have to ensure that your teeth and gums are healthy. Teeth whitening can also be done in-office or with our specially designed at-home treatments. This will be determined by the severity of treatment needed on your teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of teeth whitening </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-office teeth whitening: </strong>This will be done at our clinic. After your teeth are cleaned, a whitening gel will be applied to your teeth and activated using blue light. This process is completed within 1-2 hours.</li>
<li><strong>At-home teeth whitening: </strong>Your dentist will take molds of your teeth and then prepare custom fitted trays for you to take home with instructions. This process is takes longer than in-office whitening and can take up to a few weeks to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Combination whitening-If your teeth needs intensive whitening to achieve the desired results in-office and home teeth whitening is combined to do it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect at your teeth whitening appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your teeth and gums are cleaned in a previous appointment.</li>
<li>When you arrive for teeth whitening, your dentist will recommend in-office whitening or at-home whitening depending on the condition of your teeth or a combination of both.</li>
<li>In-office teeth whitening is done under the supervision of your dentist. A bleaching gel will be applied to your teeth and then activated using a blue light. This process takes 1-2 hours to complete.</li>
<li>If you are given customized trays for at-home whitening, you will apply the bleaching gel in the tray before use and use them for half hour to an hour at home or overnight, as recommended by your dentist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does teeth whitening last?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can last up to a year. You can also get slight touch ups done during the year. It also depends on individual habits. If you drink staining liquids like wine, coffee or tea or smoke, your teeth whitening results may not last as long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is teeth whitening safe?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can cause temporary sensitivity but it does not cause any permanent damage to your tooth enamel. In-office teeth whitening is closely supervised by our dentists and you are given proper instructions for at-home teeth whitening kits that are customized to your teeth’s condition and strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your teeth after whitening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking or drinking staining drinks such as wine, tea or coffee.</li>
<li>Avoid very hot or very cold foods and drinks as your teeth will be sensitive for the first few days after treatment.</li>
<li>You will be given a desensitizing varnish to use on your teeth for a few days after the treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dental X-rays can help your dentist to detect problems, like cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth. Book your dental x-ray appointment today with Lifeline Wisdom Dental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When is a Dental X-Ray needed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dental X-rays are images of your teeth that your dentist uses to assess your oral health. Dental X-rays are done with very low levels of radiation to capture images of the inside of your mouth.</li>
<li>Dental X-rays may seem complicated, but they are actually quite common and are just as important as your regular teeth cleanings. They provide your dentist with the most detail allowing them to correctly locate cavities, roots of the teeth, check overall oral health and view bone and tooth formation.</li>
<li>There are 3 types of Intraoral Radiographs known as Bitewing, Periapical and Occlusal, all of which show various angles and perspectives of the mouth and gums allowing the dentist to highlight the specific area they need to identify and diagnose or treat.</li>
<li>There may be many reasons why you need to have an x-ray including but not limited to age, tooth and gum development, maintaining oral health or prior to other forms of dental treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental X-Ray appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dental X-rays do not require any special preparation. It is generally recommended that you brush your teeth before your appointment because X-rays are usually done before cleanings and this creates a hygienic environment for your dentist.</li>
<li>Once you come in for you appointment, you will be sat in the treatment chair with a lead vest across your chest and lap. The X-ray machine is positioned on the side of your head to record the images.</li>
<li>It is a fairly simple procedure and it only takes a few minutes.</li>
<li>Results are instant and then your dentist will share the results with you immediately after and discuss any apparent problems and the treatment required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of X-Rays</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitewing: </strong>This technique involves biting down on a special piece of paper so that your dentist can see how the crowns of your teeth match up. This is normally used to check for cavities between your teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Occlusal</strong>: This is done when your jaw is closed to see how the upper and bottom teeth match up. It can also detect any abnormalities with the floor of the mouth or the palate. This technique shows all of your teeth in one X-ray.</li>
<li><strong>Panoramic</strong>. This type of X-ray involves the machine rotating around your head. Your dentist may use this method to check your wisdom teeth or examine jaw problems.</li>
<li><strong>Periapical</strong>. This technique focuses on two complete teeth from root to crown.</li>
</ul>
