<p>Make over your smile today by getting dental veneers. Call Lifeline Wisdom Dental today for a complete smile makeover!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get back your smile</li>
<li>Restore your confidence</li>
<li>Long lasting results</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are Veneers?</strong></p>
<p>A veneer is a thin covering that is applied over your original teeth giving them a much whiter look and the appearance of a more regular and symmetrical smile. This particular treatment may be required if your teeth are chipped, stained and discoloured or there are gaps between your teeth. As these are much thinner and less preparation of the original tooth is required in comparison to a crown, these can be a more affordable and practical option for those who have less damage to their teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Veneers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Porcelain Veneers: These types of veneers resemble the natural look of your teeth and resist staining. These are custom made in the lab and fitted according to your specifications. However, they have to be replaced if they get chipped or break.</li>
<li>Composite Veneers: These are a less costly alternative than porcelain veneers and are made out of a composite resin and are bonded directly to your teeth. They also have a shorter application process as compared to porcelain veneers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who can get Dental Veneers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your teeth are in relatively good health but are misshapen, discoloured or chipped,</li>
<li>If you have good gum health and are able to sustain good oral health,</li>
<li>If your tooth enamel is not damaged and is in good condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you are the perfect candidate for dental veneers.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Veneers appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your dentist will thoroughly clean your teeth and some of your tooth enamel will be taken and sent to the lab.</li>
<li>Then your dentist will prepare a mould of your teeth and that will also be sent to the lab and you will be fitted with temporary veneers till your next appointment.</li>
<li>At your next appointment, your dentist will bond the prepared veneers to your teeth with resin cement.</li>
<li>Another follow up appointment may be required for contouring the veneers and to check your overall gum health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for taking care of your Veneers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth such as coffee, tea or wine.</li>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth regularly just as you would your natural teeth.</li>
<li>Avoid eating very hard foods to avoid breakage or chipping of the veneers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have damaged, discoloured or broken teeth, contact Lifeline Wisdom Dental today to restore your smile and get your confidence back today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your oral health</li>
<li>Improve your self-esteem</li>
<li>Protect your teeth</li>
<li>Get a great smile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are dental crowns?</strong></p>
<p>Dental crowns are artificial tooth coloured caps that are placed on top of your natural damaged tooth to improve their appearance. Crowns are also used to fill large fillings or to provide a protective cover after root canal. Porcelain or ceramic crowns can be matched to your teeth and while metal crowns are more effective, they are usually recommended for the back of the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What are dental bridges?</strong></p>
<p>A dental bridge is designed to permanently replace any gap that has been left by any missing teeth with new false ones. This procedure will be suitable for you if the teeth that are surrounding the gap are healthy and strong. Having a gap in your mouth from a missing tooth can cause issues not only to your self-esteem and confidence but can also create potential long term effects to your gums and surrounding teeth over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who can get dental bridges or crowns?</strong></p>
<p>If you have gaps in your teeth, leaving them untreated can cause the surrounding teeth to shift and change their place. That gap is filled by the replacement fake tooth so it can blend with your natural teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Different types of dental bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most commonly used type of dental bridge used. This type of bridge is attached to the surrounding teeth with a fake tooth in between. A traditional bridge is anchored by your own teeth while the fake tooth “bridges” the gap. This may require some adjustments to you’re the adjoining teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cantilever bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>These type of bridges are commonly used towards the front of the mouth and only use a single tooth as an anchor. They can put too much pressure, however, on one tooth and are only advised in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary land bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>For these types of bridges, a metal framework is used as an anchor. This metal frame is bonded to the back of the surrounding teeth and does not require any adjustments to the surrounding teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental bridge or crown appointment at Lifeline Dental Wisdom?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of the procedure the dentist will need to trim and prepare the surrounding teeth in preparation to attach the new bridge.</li>
<li>A mould will be taken and once ready, will be cemented and fixed giving you a completely fresh new smile.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your dental crown and bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth twice daily to maintain your oral health.</li>
<li>Use an interdental brush to clean under the bridge once a day.</li>
<li>Routine 6 monthly check up with the dentist.</li>
</ul>

<li>Quick whitening</li>
<li>Long lasting results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Teeth tend to get stained over time as a result of smoking or drinking wine, tea and coffee. Sometimes teeth can also get discolored due to injury or trauma to the tooth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who can get teeth whitening needed?</strong></p>
<p>Bleaching works on natural teeth. Before opting for any teeth whitening treatment, we have to ensure that your teeth and gums are healthy. Teeth whitening can also be done in-office or with our specially designed at-home treatments. This will be determined by the severity of treatment needed on your teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of teeth whitening </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-office teeth whitening: </strong>This will be done at our clinic. After your teeth are cleaned, a whitening gel will be applied to your teeth and activated using blue light. This process is completed within 1-2 hours.</li>
<li><strong>At-home teeth whitening: </strong>Your dentist will take molds of your teeth and then prepare custom fitted trays for you to take home with instructions. This process is takes longer than in-office whitening and can take up to a few weeks to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Combination whitening-If your teeth needs intensive whitening to achieve the desired results in-office and home teeth whitening is combined to do it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect at your teeth whitening appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your teeth and gums are cleaned in a previous appointment.</li>
<li>When you arrive for teeth whitening, your dentist will recommend in-office whitening or at-home whitening depending on the condition of your teeth or a combination of both.</li>
<li>In-office teeth whitening is done under the supervision of your dentist. A bleaching gel will be applied to your teeth and then activated using a blue light. This process takes 1-2 hours to complete.</li>
<li>If you are given customized trays for at-home whitening, you will apply the bleaching gel in the tray before use and use them for half hour to an hour at home or overnight, as recommended by your dentist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does teeth whitening last?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can last up to a year. You can also get slight touch ups done during the year. It also depends on individual habits. If you drink staining liquids like wine, coffee or tea or smoke, your teeth whitening results may not last as long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is teeth whitening safe?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can cause temporary sensitivity but it does not cause any permanent damage to your tooth enamel. In-office teeth whitening is closely supervised by our dentists and you are given proper instructions for at-home teeth whitening kits that are customized to your teeth’s condition and strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your teeth after whitening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking or drinking staining drinks such as wine, tea or coffee.</li>
<li>Avoid very hot or very cold foods and drinks as your teeth will be sensitive for the first few days after treatment.</li>
<li>You will be given a desensitizing varnish to use on your teeth for a few days after the treatment.</li>
</ul>
