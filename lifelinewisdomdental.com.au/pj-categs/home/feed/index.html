<p>A root canal helps to keep your tooth pain-free and infection free. Book your appointment today at Lifeline Wisdom Dental.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alleviation of pain and distress</li>
<li>Maintain your tooth health</li>
<li>Prevent spread of infection</li>
<li>Cost effective treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do you need a root canal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent pain and sensitivity to hot and cold food and drinks</li>
<li>Tooth discoloration or swollen gums</li>
<li>Pain while eating or touching the tooth</li>
<li>Cracked or chipped tooth can also lead to infection</li>
<li>A loose tooth that is weak or about to break</li>
<li>A tooth that is injured by trauma or accident</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is important to get them treated right away. Consult our team of highly skilled dentists today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your root canal appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive to our clinic for your appointment, you will be escorted to the treatment room.</li>
<li>A local anesthesia will be injected to your treatment area. You will be awake during your procedure but you will not feel any pain.</li>
<li>When your tooth is numb, the infected pulp will be removed from the inside of your tooth.</li>
<li>Then your dentist will cover the area with antibiotics and seal it.</li>
<li>Your tooth will then be filled with a temporary filling which protect your teeth canals from getting infected in the future.</li>
<li>The root canal treatment is usually completed in 2-3 sittings depending on the damage to the tooth.</li>
<li>Lastly, when the treatment is completed, the tooth is covered with a permanent crown.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is better to get a root canal for a damaged tooth than to get it extracted. This way you do not lose your natural bite and it can also help with maintaining the appearance of your teeth. Root canals are also less expensive than implants or extractions.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for care after your tooth after root canal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not bite down or chew your food on the side of the treated tooth at least for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Avoid hard or sticky foods.</li>
<li>Avoid eating or drinking hot and cold foods until the anesthesia wears off.</li>
<li>If you experience pain or bleeding that lasts after 24 hours, contact your dentist.</li>
<li>Remember that your restored tooth also needs brushing and flossing like a normal tooth requires.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have damaged, discoloured or broken teeth, contact Lifeline Wisdom Dental today to restore your smile and get your confidence back today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your oral health</li>
<li>Improve your self-esteem</li>
<li>Protect your teeth</li>
<li>Get a great smile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are dental crowns?</strong></p>
<p>Dental crowns are artificial tooth coloured caps that are placed on top of your natural damaged tooth to improve their appearance. Crowns are also used to fill large fillings or to provide a protective cover after root canal. Porcelain or ceramic crowns can be matched to your teeth and while metal crowns are more effective, they are usually recommended for the back of the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What are dental bridges?</strong></p>
<p>A dental bridge is designed to permanently replace any gap that has been left by any missing teeth with new false ones. This procedure will be suitable for you if the teeth that are surrounding the gap are healthy and strong. Having a gap in your mouth from a missing tooth can cause issues not only to your self-esteem and confidence but can also create potential long term effects to your gums and surrounding teeth over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who can get dental bridges or crowns?</strong></p>
<p>If you have gaps in your teeth, leaving them untreated can cause the surrounding teeth to shift and change their place. That gap is filled by the replacement fake tooth so it can blend with your natural teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Different types of dental bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most commonly used type of dental bridge used. This type of bridge is attached to the surrounding teeth with a fake tooth in between. A traditional bridge is anchored by your own teeth while the fake tooth “bridges” the gap. This may require some adjustments to you’re the adjoining teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cantilever bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>These type of bridges are commonly used towards the front of the mouth and only use a single tooth as an anchor. They can put too much pressure, however, on one tooth and are only advised in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary land bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>For these types of bridges, a metal framework is used as an anchor. This metal frame is bonded to the back of the surrounding teeth and does not require any adjustments to the surrounding teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental bridge or crown appointment at Lifeline Dental Wisdom?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of the procedure the dentist will need to trim and prepare the surrounding teeth in preparation to attach the new bridge.</li>
<li>A mould will be taken and once ready, will be cemented and fixed giving you a completely fresh new smile.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your dental crown and bridges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth twice daily to maintain your oral health.</li>
<li>Use an interdental brush to clean under the bridge once a day.</li>
<li>Routine 6 monthly check up with the dentist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Want to put the sparkle back into your smile? Contact Lifeline Wisdom Dental today to restore a whiter, more radiant smile!</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore your smile</li>
<li>Restore your confidence</li>
<li>Quick whitening</li>
<li>Long lasting results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Teeth tend to get stained over time as a result of smoking or drinking wine, tea and coffee. Sometimes teeth can also get discolored due to injury or trauma to the tooth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who can get teeth whitening needed?</strong></p>
<p>Bleaching works on natural teeth. Before opting for any teeth whitening treatment, we have to ensure that your teeth and gums are healthy. Teeth whitening can also be done in-office or with our specially designed at-home treatments. This will be determined by the severity of treatment needed on your teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of teeth whitening </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-office teeth whitening: </strong>This will be done at our clinic. After your teeth are cleaned, a whitening gel will be applied to your teeth and activated using blue light. This process is completed within 1-2 hours.</li>
<li><strong>At-home teeth whitening: </strong>Your dentist will take molds of your teeth and then prepare custom fitted trays for you to take home with instructions. This process is takes longer than in-office whitening and can take up to a few weeks to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Combination whitening-If your teeth needs intensive whitening to achieve the desired results in-office and home teeth whitening is combined to do it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to expect at your teeth whitening appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your teeth and gums are cleaned in a previous appointment.</li>
<li>When you arrive for teeth whitening, your dentist will recommend in-office whitening or at-home whitening depending on the condition of your teeth or a combination of both.</li>
<li>In-office teeth whitening is done under the supervision of your dentist. A bleaching gel will be applied to your teeth and then activated using a blue light. This process takes 1-2 hours to complete.</li>
<li>If you are given customized trays for at-home whitening, you will apply the bleaching gel in the tray before use and use them for half hour to an hour at home or overnight, as recommended by your dentist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does teeth whitening last?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can last up to a year. You can also get slight touch ups done during the year. It also depends on individual habits. If you drink staining liquids like wine, coffee or tea or smoke, your teeth whitening results may not last as long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is teeth whitening safe?</strong></p>
<p>Teeth whitening can cause temporary sensitivity but it does not cause any permanent damage to your tooth enamel. In-office teeth whitening is closely supervised by our dentists and you are given proper instructions for at-home teeth whitening kits that are customized to your teeth’s condition and strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your teeth after whitening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking or drinking staining drinks such as wine, tea or coffee.</li>
<li>Avoid very hot or very cold foods and drinks as your teeth will be sensitive for the first few days after treatment.</li>
<li>You will be given a desensitizing varnish to use on your teeth for a few days after the treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you clench your jaw too tight or grind your teeth at night? Do you play a contact sport? Call Lifeline Wisdom Dental today to get a mouth guard customized to your specifications!</p>
<ul>
<li>Protective cover</li>
<li>Prevents injury in contact sports</li>
<li>Customized to your specifications</li>
<li>Easy to clean and long-lasting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do you need a mouth guard?</strong></p>
<p>A properly fitted mouth guard should always be worn to protect your teeth during any contact sport or other types of activities where there is risk of injury or impact to the face. Without a mouthguard, significant damage may occur from such impacts causing lost or broken teeth or other facial and dental trauma. It is highly recommended that if you are planning on participating in any of these kinds of activities where there is a risk, you have a mouth guard custom fitted to the moulds and contours of your mouth to ensure maximum protection and reduce the chance of injury. Also if you grind your teeth also known as Bruxism, you are the ideal candidate for a mouth guard. At Lifeline Wisdom Dental we are committed to providing you the very best in quality in the making and maintaining of your mouthguard, giving you extra confidence to enjoy your activities safely.</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of mouth guards available at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom mouth guards:</strong> We use a mold to take an impression of your teeth and then make a custom made mouth guard so it has the best fit and protection. A custom mouthguard will be made precisely for according to your requirements, whether it is for protection from trauma during sports or for use at night if you grind your teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Boil-and-bite:</strong>These mouth protectors are made from a thermoplastic material that you can use at home to fit your teeth. All you have to do is soften the mouth guard in hot water and then place it into your mouth. When the mouth guard is in the right position, bite down on it for 20 seconds. Then you remove the device and run it under cool water. You can repeat these steps to reshape the mouth guard for the best fit.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Mouth Guards: </strong>Stock mouth guards are pre-made and readily available at pharmacies. They are quite inexpensive but can be uncomfortable to the wearer. They may also cause difficulty in breathing and talking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Mouth guard appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In your first appointment, the mold of the teeth is taken by your dentist. This is an easy and comfortable procedure and does not take long.</li>
<li>These molds are then sent to the lab so your custom mouth guard can be made by our highly skilled team.</li>
<li>You will then be called in for your second appointment and the mouth guard will be fitted and any necessary adjustments will be made by your dentist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your mouth guard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is very important to keep your mouth guard clean.</li>
<li>Rinse the mouth guard after every wear with warm water to make sure there is no debris or plaque buildup.</li>
<li>Brush the mouth guard every night with a soft toothbrush and a mild soap to clean any bacteria. Do not use toothpaste on your mouth guard.</li>
<li>After cleaning, put the mouth guard on a clean and dry surface so it completely dries before use. Do not put it back in its case till it is completely dry which will take about 15-20 minutes.</li>
<li>Keep your mouth guard in its case when not in use.</li>
<li>Do not forget to clean the case as well so your mouth guard is always stored in a clean environment.</li>

<p>If you have pain in your tooth or wisdom tooth and need an extraction, contact our well-equipped team at Lifeline Wisdom Dental today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For damaged or decayed tooth</li>
<li>Maintain your oral health</li>
<li>Pain relief</li>
<li>Prevent the spread of infection</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is a tooth extraction needed?</strong></p>
<p>There are many factors that may lead to a tooth extraction being required including significant tooth decay, gum disease, cracks in your tooth or for future orthodontic treatment such as wisdom tooth removal.</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>When is a wisdom tooth extraction needed?</strong></p>
<p>Wisdom teeth are the last permanent thing to come in and appear between the ages of 17-25. For some people, these wisdom teeth can cause problems such as coming out partially or growing at an angle where it disturbs the tooth next to it or to the back of the mouth or getting trapped within the jawbone. This is called an impacted wisdom tooth.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your extraction appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The procedure itself will be determined by a variety of factors including age and health but can generally be performed in the clinic under a local anaesthetic.</li>
<li>An X-Ray will be required to establish the severity and complexity of the damage as well as the bone and root formation.</li>
<li>Your dentist will discuss treatment options for replacement post extraction if necessary, and a treatment plan will be provided detailing costs of the procedure and information on what to expect after removal.</li>
<li>Simple extraction can be done if the tooth is visible outside the gum under local anaesthesia. Otherwise a surgical extraction has to be performed for removing impacted wisdom teeth.</li>
<li>Recovery depends on the type of procedure performed but should not take more than a week to 2 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for care after the extraction treatment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the extraction site clean specially for the first 12 hours after extraction.</li>
<li>Gently rinse your mouth after 12 hours.</li>
<li>Brush your teeth very gently for the first few days avoiding the extraction area.</li>
<li>Make sure that the blood clot that forms after treatment is not disturbed so only eat soft foods and do not smoke, drink hot liquids, drink with a straw or perform any vigorous activities for at least 72 hours.</li>
<li>Slight bleeding on the first day after extraction is normal till the blood clot forms. Contact your dentist if the bleeding does not stop.</li>
<li>You may experience some pain and swelling after the procedure. That is normal and a pain medicine will be prescribed. If the pain is too severe to bear or does not go away after a few days, contact your dentist.</li>
<li>Rest as much as you can for 24 hours after your extraction and elevate your head slightly while lying down.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Full mouth scale and clean at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>It is important to visit your local dentist at least once in 6 months. Even when you brush twice a day, there are certain places in your mouth that a traditional brush cannot reach leading to plaque collection in that area.</p>
<p>If you don’t visit your dentist regularly, you might end up with numerous of dental problems such as tartar build-up from the plaque or more serious problems such as gingivitis, periodontal disease or bleeding painful gums etc. We at Lifeline Wisdom Dental give a full package of scaling and cleaning to our patients which ensure that your mouth and teeth are regularly cleaned and any possible problems can be identified early on.</p>
<p><strong>How to identify Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>If your gums start hurting or become inflamed or even worse start bleeding when you brush, then this is a sign of periodontal disease and you should get it checked immediately. This can be a sign of something worse to come if not caught and treated early. Other symptoms include bad breath, receding gums or tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How to treat Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>The best cure for gingivitis or periodontal disease is to get regular cleaning and scaling from your dentist. A deep cleaning on a regular basis can save you from a lot of problems in the future and help you maintain your beautiful and healthy smile. It can also save your from costly treatments in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Scale and Clean appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the clean, you will feel vibrations on your teeth which may cause a sensitive sensation for some people but are not painful.</li>
<li>Once you are done, you can go back home and resume normal activities. This procedure does not require any downtime.</li>
<li>It is important to visit your dentist or dental hygienist once or twice a year to get a scale and clean to avoid tooth decay and serious gum diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for proper brushing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you brush your teeth slowly and in gentle circular motions.</li>
<li>Make sure you keep brushing your teeth for 2 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Replace your brush every 3 months.</li>
<li>Do not forget to clean your tongue gently with your brush.</li>
<li>Do not forget to floss at least once a day. If you notice any bleeding, report it to your dentist on your next visit.</li>
<li>Avoid eating too many sugary foods or drinks.</li>
