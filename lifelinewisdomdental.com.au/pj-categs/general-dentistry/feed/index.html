<p><strong>Full mouth scale and clean at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>It is important to visit your local dentist at least once in 6 months. Even when you brush twice a day, there are certain places in your mouth that a traditional brush cannot reach leading to plaque collection in that area.</p>
<p>If you don’t visit your dentist regularly, you might end up with numerous of dental problems such as tartar build-up from the plaque or more serious problems such as gingivitis, periodontal disease or bleeding painful gums etc. We at Lifeline Wisdom Dental give a full package of scaling and cleaning to our patients which ensure that your mouth and teeth are regularly cleaned and any possible problems can be identified early on.</p>
<p><strong>How to identify Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>If your gums start hurting or become inflamed or even worse start bleeding when you brush, then this is a sign of periodontal disease and you should get it checked immediately. This can be a sign of something worse to come if not caught and treated early. Other symptoms include bad breath, receding gums or tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How to treat Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>The best cure for gingivitis or periodontal disease is to get regular cleaning and scaling from your dentist. A deep cleaning on a regular basis can save you from a lot of problems in the future and help you maintain your beautiful and healthy smile. It can also save your from costly treatments in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Scale and Clean appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the clean, you will feel vibrations on your teeth which may cause a sensitive sensation for some people but are not painful.</li>
<li>Once you are done, you can go back home and resume normal activities. This procedure does not require any downtime.</li>
<li>It is important to visit your dentist or dental hygienist once or twice a year to get a scale and clean to avoid tooth decay and serious gum diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for proper brushing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you brush your teeth slowly and in gentle circular motions.</li>
<li>Make sure you keep brushing your teeth for 2 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Replace your brush every 3 months.</li>
<li>Do not forget to clean your tongue gently with your brush.</li>
<li>Do not forget to floss at least once a day. If you notice any bleeding, report it to your dentist on your next visit.</li>

<p>Do you feel like your teeth are damaged? Do you feel sensitivity when you consume hot and cold foods and drinks? Book your appointment today at Lifeline Wisdom Dental to know the available treatments and fillings to solve these problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different kinds of fillings available</li>
<li>Mostly done in one appointment</li>
<li>Get rid of sensitivity and pain</li>
<li>Repair your damaged teeth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dental fillings at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>In order to treat a cavity, your dentist needs to remove the decayed part of your tooth and replace it with an artificial filling. Fillings can also be used to treat cracked or broken teeth. There are several materials used for dental fillings:</p>
<p><strong>How to identify if you are in need of a dental filling?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to hot and cold</li>
<li>Toothache or pain</li>
<li>Bleeding while flossing or brushing</li>
<li>Tooth that feels rough to the touch</li>
<li>Broken tooth due to accident or contact sports</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all cavities are painful and you may not be able to tell for a long time that you are in need of a filling. This is why it is important that you visit your dentist on a regular basis or every 6 months for scaling and cleaning your tooth so such problems can be identified.</p>
<p><strong>Different kinds of fillings available at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<p>Composite fillings:</p>
<p>Composite fillings are tooth-colored fillings and they are made from resin. They are a good option for small to mid-sized fillings and are great for people who prefer a matching filling on their tooth.</p>
<p>Glass Ionomer fillings:</p>
<p>Glass Ionomer fillings form a chemical bond with the tooth and are also tooth colored. They are not as strong as composite fillings but a good option to fill in the corners of the teeth. They also prevent further tooth decay by releasing fluoride. These also require less time because they are done fairly quickly. These types of fillings are also used on baby teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lays and On lays:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lays and On lays are high-strength fillings and they are used for molars and pre-molars. These can also be used to fill a tooth that is too damaged to support a basic filling. They are mostly used for restorative work to the teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your filling appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book your appointment with our highly qualified dentist and come in relaxed. Getting a filling is a relatively painless procedure and it does not take very long. The filling is prepared, attached to your tooth and polished and you are done.</li>
<li>In lays and on lays require more than one visit but the other fillings are completed in one sitting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips to care for your fillings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid eating hard or sticky foods.</li>
<li>Avoid very hot or cold drinks and food.</li>
<li>Bite and chew carefully.</li>
<li>Avoid chewing in the area for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Be careful not to bite your lips and tongue if numb.</li>
<li>Report to your dentist if the filling comes out or the area starts bleeding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips for what do to in a dental emergency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in severe pain, it is okay to take over-the-counter pain medication for a few days but it is not advisable to delay the problem such as pain in your gums or root canal as it can cause more serious problems in the future.</li>
<li>If you are experiencing tooth pain, rinse your mouth with warm salty water while you wait for your appointment. If possible gently floss around the tooth that hurts to remove any food particles that may be exacerbating the pain.</li>
<li>If you are experiencing severe sensitivity in your teeth or tooth pain while biting down on something or a persisting pain or swelling in your jaw or tooth, it is a sign that you might need to get a root canal treatment.</li>
<li>If your tooth gets knocked out by dental injury or accident, don’t panic. Clean and save the knocked out tooth by putting it in milk. Be careful not to touch the tooth by the root end and to only handle it by the crown end so the roots do not get damaged. Once you have saved the tooth, call our practice immediately and we will book you in on the nearest available appointment.</li>
<li>If you have any post-surgery complications from an extraction or root canal such as infection which can be identified by pain and swelling around the affected area or you may experience a fever, call our clinic immediately and you will be booked in as soon as possible.</li>

<p>A root canal helps to keep your tooth pain-free and infection free. Book your appointment today at Lifeline Wisdom Dental.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alleviation of pain and distress</li>
<li>Maintain your tooth health</li>
<li>Prevent spread of infection</li>
<li>Cost effective treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do you need a root canal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent pain and sensitivity to hot and cold food and drinks</li>
<li>Tooth discoloration or swollen gums</li>
<li>Pain while eating or touching the tooth</li>
<li>Cracked or chipped tooth can also lead to infection</li>
<li>A loose tooth that is weak or about to break</li>
<li>A tooth that is injured by trauma or accident</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is important to get them treated right away. Consult our team of highly skilled dentists today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your root canal appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive to our clinic for your appointment, you will be escorted to the treatment room.</li>
<li>A local anesthesia will be injected to your treatment area. You will be awake during your procedure but you will not feel any pain.</li>
<li>When your tooth is numb, the infected pulp will be removed from the inside of your tooth.</li>
<li>Then your dentist will cover the area with antibiotics and seal it.</li>
<li>Your tooth will then be filled with a temporary filling which protect your teeth canals from getting infected in the future.</li>
<li>The root canal treatment is usually completed in 2-3 sittings depending on the damage to the tooth.</li>
<li>Lastly, when the treatment is completed, the tooth is covered with a permanent crown.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is better to get a root canal for a damaged tooth than to get it extracted. This way you do not lose your natural bite and it can also help with maintaining the appearance of your teeth. Root canals are also less expensive than implants or extractions.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for care after your tooth after root canal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not bite down or chew your food on the side of the treated tooth at least for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Avoid hard or sticky foods.</li>
<li>Avoid eating or drinking hot and cold foods until the anesthesia wears off.</li>
<li>If you experience pain or bleeding that lasts after 24 hours, contact your dentist.</li>
<li>Remember that your restored tooth also needs brushing and flossing like a normal tooth requires.</li>

<p>Dental X-rays can help your dentist to detect problems, like cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth. Book your dental x-ray appointment today with Lifeline Wisdom Dental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When is a Dental X-Ray needed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dental X-rays are images of your teeth that your dentist uses to assess your oral health. Dental X-rays are done with very low levels of radiation to capture images of the inside of your mouth.</li>
<li>Dental X-rays may seem complicated, but they are actually quite common and are just as important as your regular teeth cleanings. They provide your dentist with the most detail allowing them to correctly locate cavities, roots of the teeth, check overall oral health and view bone and tooth formation.</li>
<li>There are 3 types of Intraoral Radiographs known as Bitewing, Periapical and Occlusal, all of which show various angles and perspectives of the mouth and gums allowing the dentist to highlight the specific area they need to identify and diagnose or treat.</li>
<li>There may be many reasons why you need to have an x-ray including but not limited to age, tooth and gum development, maintaining oral health or prior to other forms of dental treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental X-Ray appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dental X-rays do not require any special preparation. It is generally recommended that you brush your teeth before your appointment because X-rays are usually done before cleanings and this creates a hygienic environment for your dentist.</li>
<li>Once you come in for you appointment, you will be sat in the treatment chair with a lead vest across your chest and lap. The X-ray machine is positioned on the side of your head to record the images.</li>
<li>It is a fairly simple procedure and it only takes a few minutes.</li>
<li>Results are instant and then your dentist will share the results with you immediately after and discuss any apparent problems and the treatment required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of X-Rays</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitewing: </strong>This technique involves biting down on a special piece of paper so that your dentist can see how the crowns of your teeth match up. This is normally used to check for cavities between your teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Occlusal</strong>: This is done when your jaw is closed to see how the upper and bottom teeth match up. It can also detect any abnormalities with the floor of the mouth or the palate. This technique shows all of your teeth in one X-ray.</li>
<li><strong>Panoramic</strong>. This type of X-ray involves the machine rotating around your head. Your dentist may use this method to check your wisdom teeth or examine jaw problems.</li>
<li><strong>Periapical</strong>. This technique focuses on two complete teeth from root to crown.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need dentures or need to replace your old dentures, book your appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to your old smile</li>
<li>Comfortable to wear</li>
<li>Easy to clean</li>
<li>Improve your confidence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Different types of dentures available at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:</strong></p>
<p>Dentures, or false teeth as they are more commonly named, are designed to be worn to replace missing teeth. There are 3 types of dentures available.</p>
<ul>
<li>A full denture is required worn on the gum and is required when you are replacing all of your teeth on your upper or lower gum or both.</li>
<li>Partial dentures are designed for replacement of only some teeth and are held in place by clasps that are attached to your natural teeth alongside them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your denture appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The procedure for full dentures and partial dentures is similar. They are made after the gum has healed from any extractions.</li>
<li>After the consultation, the dentist will take a mould and measurements of your teeth or gums to ensure that the dentures will fit the remaining teeth exactly if any. These results will then be sent to a dental lab that will build the dentures to the exact specifications.</li>
<li>Once the dentures are made, you will be called in for a fitting. It will be made sure at this point that the dentures fit well and you can use them without any pain or discomfort. Adjustments will be made if needed.</li>
<li>Dentures can take some time to adapt to and you may need a few adjustments initially as you get used to them. You will also need to maintain annual visits with your dentist to ensure they are still fitting correctly and no changes need to be made.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>

<p><strong>When to bring your child to the dentist?</strong></p>
<p>We encourage you to keep good oral health a priority in your child’s life. A child’s first tooth emerges at around six month’s old and over the next 12-13 years, these baby teeth will fall out and be replaced by the permanent set of teeth. Your child’s first dental visit is recommended by 12 months of age or within 6 months of the first tooth erupting. The visit includes a full exam of the teeth, jaws, bite and gums. It is your responsibility as a parent to provide your child with proper dental care so that your child’s smile is attractive and their teeth and gums are healthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of regular children’s appointments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any problems are caught on early and be addressed accordingly.</li>
<li>Regular check-ups make certain that any cavities are filled and oral hygiene is being up kept.</li>
<li>Can also help in identifying any future problems before the permanent set of teeth pushes its way in that they are aligned correctly and your child will not face any serious problems in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lifeline Wisdom Dental offers the following services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed check ups</li>
<li>Fillings and extractions for decayed teeth</li>

<p>If you have pain in your tooth or wisdom tooth and need an extraction, contact our well-equipped team at Lifeline Wisdom Dental today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For damaged or decayed tooth</li>
<li>Maintain your oral health</li>
<li>Pain relief</li>
<li>Prevent the spread of infection</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is a tooth extraction needed?</strong></p>
<p>There are many factors that may lead to a tooth extraction being required including significant tooth decay, gum disease, cracks in your tooth or for future orthodontic treatment such as wisdom tooth removal.</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>When is a wisdom tooth extraction needed?</strong></p>
<p>Wisdom teeth are the last permanent thing to come in and appear between the ages of 17-25. For some people, these wisdom teeth can cause problems such as coming out partially or growing at an angle where it disturbs the tooth next to it or to the back of the mouth or getting trapped within the jawbone. This is called an impacted wisdom tooth.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your extraction appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The procedure itself will be determined by a variety of factors including age and health but can generally be performed in the clinic under a local anaesthetic.</li>
<li>An X-Ray will be required to establish the severity and complexity of the damage as well as the bone and root formation.</li>
<li>Your dentist will discuss treatment options for replacement post extraction if necessary, and a treatment plan will be provided detailing costs of the procedure and information on what to expect after removal.</li>
<li>Simple extraction can be done if the tooth is visible outside the gum under local anaesthesia. Otherwise a surgical extraction has to be performed for removing impacted wisdom teeth.</li>
<li>Recovery depends on the type of procedure performed but should not take more than a week to 2 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for care after the extraction treatment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the extraction site clean specially for the first 12 hours after extraction.</li>
<li>Gently rinse your mouth after 12 hours.</li>
<li>Brush your teeth very gently for the first few days avoiding the extraction area.</li>
<li>Make sure that the blood clot that forms after treatment is not disturbed so only eat soft foods and do not smoke, drink hot liquids, drink with a straw or perform any vigorous activities for at least 72 hours.</li>
<li>Slight bleeding on the first day after extraction is normal till the blood clot forms. Contact your dentist if the bleeding does not stop.</li>
<li>You may experience some pain and swelling after the procedure. That is normal and a pain medicine will be prescribed. If the pain is too severe to bear or does not go away after a few days, contact your dentist.</li>
<li>Rest as much as you can for 24 hours after your extraction and elevate your head slightly while lying down.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dental Examination and Checkup (Full mouth check-up and clean)</strong></p>
<p>Has it been a while since you last visited your dentist for a checkup? Call us at Lifeline Wisdom Dental to get your appointment with our highly skilled doctors today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain your beautiful smile</li>
<li>Keep your gums and teeth healthy</li>
<li>Prevent oral diseases and problems</li>
<li>Prompt addressing of concerns and issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full mouth scale and clean at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<p>It is important to visit your local dentist at least once in 6 months. Even when you brush twice a day, there are certain places in your mouth that a traditional brush cannot reach leading to plaque collection in that area.</p>
<p>If you don’t visit your dentist regularly, you might end up with numerous of dental problems such as tartar build-up from the plaque or more serious problems such as gingivitis, periodontal disease or bleeding painful gums etc. We at Lifeline Wisdom Dental give a full package of scaling and cleaning to our patients which ensure that your mouth and teeth are regularly cleaned and any possible problems can be identified early on.</p>
<p><strong>How to identify Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>If your gums start hurting or become inflamed or even worse start bleeding when you brush, then this is a sign of periodontal disease and you should get it checked immediately. This can be a sign of something worse to come if not caught and treated early. Other symptoms include bad breath, receding gums or tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How to treat Periodontal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>The best cure for gingivitis or periodontal disease is to get regular cleaning and scaling from your dentist. A deep cleaning on a regular basis can save you from a lot of problems in the future and help you maintain your beautiful and healthy smile. It can also save your from costly treatments in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect at your Scale and Clean appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the clean, you will feel vibrations on your teeth which may cause a sensitive sensation for some people but are not painful.</li>
<li>Once you are done, you can go back home and resume normal activities. This procedure does not require any downtime.</li>
<li>It is important to visit your dentist or dental hygienist once or twice a year to get a scale and clean to avoid tooth decay and serious gum diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips for proper brushing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you brush your teeth slowly and in gentle circular motions.</li>
<li>Make sure you keep brushing your teeth for 2 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Replace your brush every 3 months.</li>
<li>Do not forget to clean your tongue gently with your brush.</li>
<li>Do not forget to floss at least once a day. If you notice any bleeding, report it to your dentist on your next visit.</li>
<li>Avoid eating too many sugary foods or drinks.</li>
