If possible gently floss around the tooth that hurts to remove any food particles that may be exacerbating the pain.<\/li>\n<li>If you are experiencing severe sensitivity in your teeth or tooth pain while biting down on something or a persisting pain or swelling in your jaw or tooth, it is a sign that you might need to get a root canal treatment.<\/li>\n<li>If your tooth gets knocked out by dental injury or accident, don\u2019t panic. Clean and save the knocked out tooth by putting it in milk. Be careful not to touch the tooth by the root end and to only handle it by the crown end so the roots do not get damaged. Once you have saved the tooth, call our practice immediately and we will book you in on the nearest available appointment.<\/li>\n<li>If you have any post-surgery complications from an extraction or root canal such as infection which can be identified by pain and swelling around the affected area or you may experience a fever, call our clinic immediately and you will be booked in as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8730,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false},"pj-categs":[59],"pj-tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 -
