Fillings can also be used to treat cracked or broken teeth. There are several materials used for dental fillings:<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to identify if you are in need of a dental filling?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sensitivity to hot and cold<\/li>\n<li>Toothache or pain<\/li>\n<li>Bleeding while flossing or brushing<\/li>\n<li>Tooth that feels rough to the touch<\/li>\n<li>Broken tooth due to accident or contact sports<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not all cavities are painful and you may not be able to tell for a long time that you are in need of a filling. This is why it is important that you visit your dentist on a regular basis or every 6 months for scaling and cleaning your tooth so such problems can be identified.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Different kinds of fillings available at Lifeline Wisdom Dental:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Composite fillings:<\/p>\n<p>Composite fillings are tooth-colored fillings and they are made from resin. They are a good option for small to mid-sized fillings and are great for people who prefer a matching filling on their tooth.<\/p>\n<p>Glass Ionomer fillings:<\/p>\n<p>Glass Ionomer fillings form a chemical bond with the tooth and are also tooth colored. They are not as strong as composite fillings but a good option to fill in the corners of the teeth. They also prevent further tooth decay by releasing fluoride. These also require less time because they are done fairly quickly. These types of fillings are also used on baby teeth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In lays and On lays:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Lays and On lays are high-strength fillings and they are used for molars and pre-molars. These can also be used to fill a tooth that is too damaged to support a basic filling. They are mostly used for restorative work to the teeth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>What to expect at your filling appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Book your appointment with our highly qualified dentist and come in relaxed.
