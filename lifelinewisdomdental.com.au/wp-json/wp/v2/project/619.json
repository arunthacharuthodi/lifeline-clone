Book your dental x-ray appointment today with Lifeline Wisdom Dental.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>When is a Dental X-Ray needed?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dental X-rays are images of your teeth that your dentist uses to assess your oral health. Dental X-rays are done with very low levels of radiation to capture images of the inside of your mouth.<\/li>\n<li>Dental X-rays may seem complicated, but they are actually quite common and are just as important as your regular teeth cleanings. They provide your dentist with the most detail allowing them to correctly locate cavities, roots of the teeth, check overall oral health and view bone and tooth formation.<\/li>\n<li>There are 3 types of Intraoral Radiographs known as Bitewing, Periapical and Occlusal, all of which show various angles and perspectives of the mouth and gums allowing the dentist to highlight the specific area they need to identify and diagnose or treat.<\/li>\n<li>There may be many reasons why you need to have an x-ray including but not limited to age, tooth and gum development, maintaining oral health or prior to other forms of dental treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental X-Ray appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dental X-rays do not require any special preparation. It is generally recommended that you brush your teeth before your appointment because X-rays are usually done before cleanings and this creates a hygienic environment for your dentist.<\/li>\n<li>Once you come in for you appointment, you will be sat in the treatment chair with a lead vest across your chest and lap. The X-ray machine is positioned on the side of your head to record the images.<\/li>\n<li>It is a fairly simple procedure and it only takes a few minutes.<\/li>\n<li>Results are instant and then your dentist will share the results with you immediately after and discuss any apparent problems and the treatment required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of X-Rays<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bitewing: <\/strong>This technique involves biting down on a special piece of paper so that your dentist can see how the crowns of your teeth match up. This is normally used to check for cavities between your teeth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Occlusal<\/strong>: This is done when your jaw is closed to see how the upper and bottom teeth match up. It can also detect any abnormalities with the floor of the mouth or the palate. This technique shows all of your teeth in one X-ray.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Panoramic<\/strong>. This type of X-ray involves the machine rotating around your head. Your dentist may use this method to check your wisdom teeth or examine jaw problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Periapical<\/strong>. This technique focuses on two complete teeth from root to crown.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8727,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false},"pj-categs":[59],"pj-tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 -
