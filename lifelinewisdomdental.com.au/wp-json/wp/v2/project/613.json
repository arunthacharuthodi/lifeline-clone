A child\u2019s first tooth emerges at around six month\u2019s old and over the next 12-13 years, these baby teeth will fall out and be replaced by the permanent set of teeth. Your child\u2019s first dental visit is recommended by 12 months of age or within 6 months of the first tooth erupting. The visit includes a full exam of the teeth, jaws, bite and gums. It is your responsibility as a parent to provide your child with proper dental care so that your child\u2019s smile is attractive and their teeth and gums are healthy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of regular children\u2019s appointments:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any problems are caught on early and be addressed accordingly.<\/li>\n<li>Regular check-ups make certain that any cavities are filled and oral hygiene is being up kept.<\/li>\n<li>Can also help in identifying any future problems before the permanent set of teeth pushes its way in that they are aligned correctly and your child will not face any serious problems in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lifeline Wisdom Dental offers the following services:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detailed check ups<\/li>\n<li>Fillings and extractions for decayed teeth<\/li>\n<li>Scaling and cleaning to prevent tartar build up<\/li>\n<li>Advice on the maintenance of good oral health<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to expect at your child\u2019s appointment with Lifeline Wisdom Dental<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our dentists will carry out a complete check-up including assessing their overall health and oral health.
