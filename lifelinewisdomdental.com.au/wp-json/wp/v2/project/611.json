For some people, these wisdom teeth can cause problems such as coming out partially or growing at an angle where it disturbs the tooth next to it or to the back of the mouth or getting trapped within the jawbone. This is called an impacted wisdom tooth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to expect at your extraction appointment at Lifeline Wisdom Dental<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The procedure itself will be determined by a variety of factors including age and health but can generally be performed in the clinic under a local anaesthetic.<\/li>\n<li>An X-Ray will be required to establish the severity and complexity of the damage as well as the bone and root formation.<\/li>\n<li>Your dentist will discuss treatment options for replacement post extraction if necessary, and a treatment plan will be provided detailing costs of the procedure and information on what to expect after removal.<\/li>\n<li>Simple extraction can be done if the tooth is visible outside the gum under local anaesthesia. Otherwise a surgical extraction has to be performed for removing impacted wisdom teeth.<\/li>\n<li>Recovery depends on the type of procedure performed but should not take more than a week to 2 weeks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tips for care after the extraction treatment:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the extraction site clean specially for the first 12 hours after extraction.<\/li>\n<li>Gently rinse your mouth after 12 hours.<\/li>\n<li>Brush your teeth very gently for the first few days avoiding the extraction area.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure that the blood clot that forms after treatment is not disturbed so only eat soft foods and do not smoke, drink hot liquids, drink with a straw or perform any vigorous activities for at least 72 hours.<\/li>\n<li>Slight bleeding on the first day after extraction is normal till the blood clot forms. Contact your dentist if the bleeding does not stop.<\/li>\n<li>You may experience some pain and swelling after the procedure. That is normal and a pain medicine will be prescribed. If the pain is too severe to bear or does not go away after a few days, contact your dentist.<\/li>\n<li>Rest as much as you can for 24 hours after your extraction and elevate your head slightly while lying down.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8543,"menu_order":3,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false},"pj-categs":[59,41],"pj-tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 -
