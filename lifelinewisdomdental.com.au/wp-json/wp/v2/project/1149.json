Crowns are also used to fill large fillings or to provide a protective cover after root canal. Porcelain or ceramic crowns can be matched to your teeth and while metal crowns are more effective, they are usually recommended for the back of the teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are dental bridges?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A dental bridge is designed to permanently replace any gap that has been left by any missing teeth with new false ones. This procedure will be suitable for you if the teeth that are surrounding the gap are healthy and strong. Having a gap in your mouth from a missing tooth can cause issues not only to your self-esteem and confidence but can also create potential long term effects to your gums and surrounding teeth over an extended period of time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who can get dental bridges or crowns?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have gaps in your teeth, leaving them untreated can cause the surrounding teeth to shift and change their place. That gap is filled by the replacement fake tooth so it can blend with your natural teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Different types of dental bridges:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional bridges<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is the most commonly used type of dental bridge used. This type of bridge is attached to the surrounding teeth with a fake tooth in between. A traditional bridge is anchored by your own teeth while the fake tooth \u201cbridges\u201d the gap. This may require some adjustments to you\u2019re the adjoining teeth.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantilever bridges<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These type of bridges are commonly used towards the front of the mouth and only use a single tooth as an anchor. They can put too much pressure, however, on one tooth and are only advised in some cases.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mary land bridges<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For these types of bridges, a metal framework is used as an anchor. This metal frame is bonded to the back of the surrounding teeth and does not require any adjustments to the surrounding teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to expect at your Dental bridge or crown appointment at Lifeline Dental Wisdom?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the time of the procedure the dentist will need to trim and prepare the surrounding teeth in preparation to attach the new bridge.<\/li>\n<li>A mould will be taken and once ready, will be cemented and fixed giving you a completely fresh new smile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tips to care for your dental crown and bridges:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brush and floss your teeth twice daily to maintain your oral health.<\/li>\n<li>Use an interdental brush to clean under the bridge once a day.<\/li>\n<li>Routine 6 monthly check up with the dentist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8561,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false},"pj-categs":[61,41],"pj-tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 -
