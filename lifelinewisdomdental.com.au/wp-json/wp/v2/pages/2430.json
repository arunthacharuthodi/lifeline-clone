Our highest priority is to serve our customers in a way that they are comfortable and relaxed during the treatment. Discuss your anxieties and fears with your dentist and they will ensure that you are taken care of accordingly.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"cmsms_toggle_wrap\" data-tags=\"all \">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_title\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_hor\"><\/span>\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_vert\"><\/span>\n<\/span>\n<a href=\"#\">Will my teeth be whiter after a scale and clean?<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle\">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_inner\">\n<p>The main purpose of a scale and clean is healthier gums. During a scale and clean, your dentist will remove the surface stains from your teeth such as those from smoking, tea or coffee. However the color of your teeth will not change. If you are looking for teeth whitening, contact our team at Lifeline Dental Wisdom today. We have many options for you.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"cmsms_toggle_wrap\" data-tags=\"all \">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_title\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_hor\"><\/span>\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_vert\"><\/span>\n<\/span>\n<a href=\"#\">What is the difference between in-office and take-home teeth whitening?<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle\">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_inner\">\n<p>In-office teeth whitening is performed and supervised by the dentist with concentrated whitening products applied to your teeth. This usually takes 1-2 hours and you can see results immediately. Teeth sensitivity is common after teeth whitening and you will be sent home with toothpaste for sensitive teeth and advised not to drink staining or very hot and cold liquids for a few days such as wine, tea and coffee.<\/p>\n<p>At-home teeth whitening consists of whitening gels with lower concentration of the bleaching agent which makes them safer to use at home. Your dentist will give you the kit along with the instructions. You can achieve the same results with an at-home whitening kit as an in-office whitening session but it will take time. You should be expected to see results in a few weeks.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"cmsms_toggle_wrap\" data-tags=\"all \">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_title\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_hor\"><\/span>\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_vert\"><\/span>\n<\/span>\n<a href=\"#\">Why is an x-ray necessary? Is it safe for me?<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle\">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_inner\">\n<p>Using an x-ray is sometimes necessary to show various angles and perspectives of the mouth and gums allowing the dentist to highlight the specific area they need to identify and diagnose or treat. There may be many reasons why you need to have an x-ray including but not limited to age, tooth and gum development, maintaining oral health or prior to other forms of dental treatment. Dental x-rays do involve radiation, but the exposure levels are very low and they are considered completely safe for the patient including children and adults.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"cmsms_toggle_wrap\" data-tags=\"all \">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_title\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus\">\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_hor\"><\/span>\n<span class=\"cmsms_toggle_plus_vert\"><\/span>\n<\/span>\n<a href=\"#\">When is a tooth extraction necessary?<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle\">\n<div class=\"cmsms_toggle_inner\">\n<p>Sometimes a tooth can be damaged and decayed to a point where it is beyond repair.
